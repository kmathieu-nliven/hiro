837-Q1
This X12 Transaction Set contains the format and establishes the data 
contents of the Health Care Claim Transaction Set (837) for use within the 
context of an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) environment. This 
transaction set can be used to submit health care claim billing information, 
encounter information, or both, from providers of health care services to 
payers, either directly or via intermediary billers and claims 
clearinghouses. It can also be used to transmit health care claims and 
billing payment information between payers with different payment 
responsibilities where coordination of benefits is required or between 
payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or 
payment of health care services within a specific health care/insurance 
industry segment.For purposes of this standard, providers of health care products or services 
may include entities such as physicians, hospitals and other medical 
facilities or suppliers, dentists, and pharmacies, and entities providing 
medical information to meet regulatory requirements. The payer refers to a 
third party entity that pays claims or administers the insurance product or 
benefit or both. For example, a payer may be an insurance company, health 
maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), 
government agency (Medicare, Medicaid, Civilian Health and Medical Program 
of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), etc.) or an entity such as a third 
party administrator (TPA) or third party organization (TPO) that may be 
contracted by one of those groups. A regulatory agency is an entity 
responsible, by law or rule, for administering and monitoring a statutory 
benefits program or a specific health care/insurance industry segment.

A type recording instrument which employs flexible vessels that expand when 
pressure is applied; the movement or expansion of the vessels is an 
indicator of the pressure applied; bellows meters are commonly used in low 
pressure or differential pressure measurement; "Bellows Meter" terminology 
is used to indicate that corrections in volume calculations are applied with 
respect to Bellows recorder characteristics
*ELENTE
1373, ,DM,1
A metering instrument in which mechanical displacement of known volume 
chambers are repeatedly filled and emptied; the volume of the chambers times 
the cycles of displacement is equal to the measure of volume; "Displacement 
Meter" terminology may also be used to define the application of volume 
calculation
*ELENTE
1373, ,FT,1
A critical parameter of design for orifice measurement where the pressure 
ports for the sensing of static and differential pressure are located one 
inch upstream and one inch downstream of the orifice plate; "Flange Tap" 
terminology is used to define the tap configuration employed
*ELENTE

An axle mounted device to measure distance traveled by a motor vehicle
*ELENTE
1373, ,MM,1
A type of recording instrument which employs mercury displacement in a fixed 
chamber when pressure is applied, the displacement is an indicator of the 
pressure applied; the mercury recorder is primarily used in low pressure 
differential pressure measurement; "Mercury Meter" terminology is used to 
indicate that corrections is volume calculations are applied with respect to 
mercury recorder characteristics
*ELENTE
1373, ,OM,1
A metering instrument used to measure flowing fluid through a pipe by 
velocity displacement and employing orifice technologies; the orifice meter 
is an inferential device which senses the pressure differential created by 
the passage of a fluid through an orifice of critical diameter placed in the 
pipe; a rate of flow is calculated from the fluid flowing and instrument 
parameters to determine the measure of volume; "Orifice Meter" terminology 
may also be used to define the application of volume calculation
*ELENTE
1373, ,PT,1
A critical parameter of design for orifice measurement where the pressure 
ports for the sensing of static and differential pressure are located in a 
distance of two and one-half times the published inside diameter of the 
meter upstream of the orifice place and a distance of eight times the 
published inside diameter of the meter downstream of the orifice plate; 
"Pipe Tap" terminology is used to define the tap configuration employed
*ELENTE
1373, ,TM,1
A type of metering instrument used to measure flowing fluid through a pipe 
by velocity displacement and employing turbine senses the rotation of a 
rotor axis turbine which is parallel to the axis of flow and proportional to 
the rate; the measure of volume is determined by counting the revolutions of 
the rotor; "Turbine Meter" terminology may also be used to define the 
application of volume calculation
